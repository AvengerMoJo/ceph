v0.81
-----

- Disallow nonsensical 'tier cache-mode' transitions.  From this point
  onward, 'writeback' can only transition to 'forward' and 'forward'
  can transition to 1) 'writeback' if there are dirty objects, or 2) any if
  there are no dirty objects.

v0.82
-----

- The 'osd map ...' CLI command output syntax has changed slightly:
  the "up" and "acting" fields are now JSON arrays of integers instead
  of strings.
